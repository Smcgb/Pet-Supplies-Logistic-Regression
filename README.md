# Pet-Supplies-Logistic-Regression

This project used basic EDA process on the Pet Supplies dataset. This is an open dataset provided by DataCamp with a public dictionary that can be found at Using the Pet Supplies dataset made available by datacamp, data will be cleaned, validated and tested in an EDA format. The data dictionary can be found at https://s3.amazonaws.com/talent-assets.datacamp.com/Practical+-+DAA+-+Pet+Supplies+-+2212.pdf

The following compentcies were tested 

    Data Validation	- Assess data quality and perform validation tasks
    Create data visualizations to demonstrate the characteristics of data and represent relationships between features

    Data Visualization	
    Create data visualizations to demonstrate the characteristics of data and represent relationships between features

    Communication	
    Presents data concepts to small, diverse audiences

Before taking this, a SQL and data analytics assessment (DA101) was taken to asses the following:

DA101 is a 60-minute exam that assesses your proficiency in data management, exploratory analysis, and statistical experimentation using SQL. To successfully pass this exam, you should be able to:

    Perform data extraction, joining and aggregation tasks
    Perform cleaning tasks to prepare data for analysis
    Assess data quality and perform validation tasks
    Calculate metrics to effectively report characteristics of data and relationships between features.
    Read, and analyze data visualizations to represent the relationships between features.
    Describe statistical concepts that underpin hypothesis testing and experimentation.
